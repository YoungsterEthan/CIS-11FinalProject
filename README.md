This is a program that takes 5 test scores that the user inputs and then calculates the minimum, maximum, and average score of the 5 inputted test scores.

When inputting a test score, 3 digits must be inputted, regardless of whether the hundreds/hundreds & tens place is 0 or not. That is to say, if the number does not go higher than 9, a zero must be inputted as the tens and hundreds place (example: a test score of 4 would be 004), and if the number does not go higher than 99, a zero must be inputted as the hundreds place (example: a test score of 95 would be 095). The program will automatically send the user to the next prompt the moment the ones place digit is typed.
